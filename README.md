# PROJECT ALLIN1

## Project Motto

### To create a one stop shop for all things volunteering related.

## Rationale behind the project

- Breaching the gap between front end and back end, allowing a centralized database to be easily accessible through the use of a website.
- Providing a hassle free experience for volunteers to sign up for events as well as keep track of their hours and earn rewards.
- Allowing the administrators to reap the benefits of a centralized database, thus providing in-depth analysis on each event.

## How to view the website remotely

1. Visit https://big-at-heart-v1.vercel.app/

Note: As the server is a free tier, sometimes it might lag, please be patient. Alternatively, you can run it locally.

## How does the project work?

1. First Time Users
   First time users are able to register an account through the home page. Note that clicking on any other links will also lead you to the login page due to security measures put in place (middleware.ts)

2. Volunteers
   Volunteers are able to sign up for events with a click of a button. They are also able to track their volunteering hours and request certificate from past events.

3. Admins
   Admins will have access to the dashboard tab. Through the use of a dashboard, they are able to manage forms submitted by volunteers, create and track both past and upcoming events as well as get analysis on the events.
